Strategy: a word that is too emotional 

As I moved up the ladder in my career, I transitioned into what one could call more strategic positions as opposed to operational ones. I do not like to use the term strategy as one being put in conjunction with hierarchy. I believe there is an emotionality and a sense of protection of this word by senior management as if the act of strategising would be of exclusive use of a few. So why is it that there is this seriousness and almost defensiveness around this word? I have been trying to make sense of that and one interesting way of looking at it is that the higher you go into the hierarchy, the less operational you are and therefore strategy becomes a key part of the senior  management's identity. In a classic view of management and leadership, sharing the act of coming up with a strategy means losing a positioning, a way to make sense of senior's management purpose and existence. 

The risk for senior management to focus so strongly on being strategic and to spend its time analysing the past and trying to control what has not happened yet by defining strategies is to lose contact with the present.

What I mean by being present as a leader is to work with what happens in the here and now, attending to what is going on in a meeting, in a one-to-one and to create meaning in the moment. It has to do with an ability to let go preformed ideas, plans and strategies and to actually accept that something good will emerge from whatever is going on.

This is a very difficult gesture because it means that as a leader I need the reinvent what I am and my identity, to find a new way to be and to act in a leadership position - moving from this hero-like position towards a more participative view of leadership. The reward by doing so is that I stop to put this huge pressure on my shoulders that I am actually responsible for the answers of others and can focus on the only thing I can control: my gestures and my intentions.
